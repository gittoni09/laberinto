# laberinto
Short program to create a console based laberinth (Laberinto in Spanish) and to resolve it using a trial and error algorithm.
This Python 3 program has been inspired in the ZX Spectrum version and adapted to the Python curses library and to the Python data structures.
The original ZX Spectrum BASIC program to build the laberith was created by Paco Martin and published in the Microhobby magazine #26, ca. 1985. The algorithm to resolve the laberinth has been inspired in the ideas of Sergio Martinez in #29 of the same magazine.
